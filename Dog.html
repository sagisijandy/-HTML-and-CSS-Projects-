<h1>Puppyhood is not only one of the most challenging times in your dog's life, it is also a time of crucial brain development. Your puppy is learning how to behave around humans, how to feel about them, and how to live with them.</h1>

<strong>80% of your puppy's brain is fully developed by 20 weeks of age.</strong>

<h1>In just a few short months, dogs go from mewling, blind newborns to the developmental equivalent of a ten year old child. Do not Miss this crucial stage of development. The experiences your puppy has during those early months will create a lasting impact on your dog's behaviour and personality.
It also sets the stage for your relationship with your dog.</h1>
